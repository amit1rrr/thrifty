AWS service offering is great but Iâ€™m not a big fan of their documentation or the console. With 100+ services, different configurations & tiers, it becomes really cumbersome to understand & optimize AWS cost. Pearls of wisdom like [this](https://segment.com/blog/the-million-dollar-eng-problem/) & [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15587627) are spread all across the web.
This is an attempt to consolidate AWS cost optimization tips & document them in easy to use, actionable format.

## How to use
Take a look at your monthly AWS bill. Pick services that are most expensive for you. Look at the cost optimization tips for those services and see what you can apply in your environment.

## Supported AWS services

* [RDS](services/rds.md)
